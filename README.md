There are three files in the Git Repo.

PLEASE GO THROUGH IT CAREFULLY and let me know if any questions on the explaining part

Second is **PythonPipeline.py** its a Python code for the Solution I have provided for the Problem I was given. 
The code has comments which explains what it does.

Third file which is output of my pipeline , the output Json Data " **cleaned_product_data.json** "

# STEPS TO RUN PYTHON FILE

Download pycharm , my version is **PyCharm 2024.2.4**

Once you copy and paste the code from my repo you will have to install the packages into Pycharm.
I have installed the default latest version


 # STEPS TO INSTALL MONGO DB

Install **MONGO DB** Latest Stable Version and Download **MONGO DB COMPASS** for UI as its shows you the Document on UI

COnfigure Mongo DB on your Local Setup and RUN the code.

This code runs fine and end to end.

# CONFIDENCE LEVEL

For confidence level I have not included in the main code but uploaded a file in Github where I understand what confidence level means. As I am not a machine learning Engineer, I tried my best to make my self understand and done some simple function implementation.

PS: This code is not  merged with the main code as it was an optional ask.

# HAPPY CODE TESTING
